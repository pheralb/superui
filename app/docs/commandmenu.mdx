This component is made with the package called [CMDK](https://cmdk.paco.me/).

## Installation

```jsx
import { CommandMenu } from "@superui/styles";
```

## Usage

This module should be placed where you want the menu to appear.

<br />
For example, in Next.js you can place it at `app.js` to make it appear in the whole
app.

```jsx
import { CommandMenu } from "@superui/styles";

const data = [...];

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <CommandMenu data={data} />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Data Structure

In the data array you can place all the items you want to show in the menu.

```jsx
const data = [
  {
    heading: "Example Heading", // This is the name of the group
    items: [
      {
        name: "Example Item", // This is the name of the item
        onSelect: () => {
          // Function to call when the item is selected
          console.log("Example Label clicked");
        },
        icon: <ExampleIcon />, // This is the icon to show next to the item
        type: "Component", // This is the label of the item.
      },
    ],
  },
];
```
